B--tree-vs-hashing
==================

This is a semester project for Data Structure and Algorithms course. The project aims at comparing the performance of B+ trees and hashing in sorting using various test case files(ranging fom 10 to 100000000). Hashing seems impractical for large test cases and therefore is clubbed with binary tree formation at each index of the hash table.
